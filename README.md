# Valo Index

Valo Index is a site that I built while I was learning how to use react. All data is rendered from the [Valorant Api](https://valorant-api.com/). While building this site I was able to get more familiar with the useState & useEffect react hooks as well as React Router.

## Features
- Users can view all current characters in the game as well as their details
- Users can view all maps in the game
- Users can use the agent selector to have a character suggested to them based on their selected preferences
